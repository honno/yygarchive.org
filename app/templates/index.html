        <h2 class="title is-3 mb-2">Pre-emptive Frequently Asked Questsions</h2>

        <h3 class="title is-5 mb-2">What is this?</h3>
        <p>A searchable collection of <a href="https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker">GameMaker</a> games that were available on the old games portal for YoYo Games, which launched in 2007 on <code>yoyogames.com</code>. In 2011 it was moved to <code>sandbox.yoyogames.com</code>, and was shutdown in 2016. Due to the portal being moved to the <code>sandbox</code> sub-domain, I will refer the the old YoYo Games website as "Sandbox".

        <h3 class="title is-5 mt-4 mb-2">What games are available?</h3>
        <p>Nearly all the games available on the site in 2014 when it was <a href="https://www.archiveteam.org/index.php/GameMaker_Sandbox">saved</a> by the archivist group <a href="https://www.archiveteam.org">ArchiveTeam</a>, so a bit over 100000 games.</p>
        <p>Some were missing from that collection, but I'll be hoping to recover them in due time.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5 mt-4 mb-2">There already was an archive? What's the point of this then?</h3>
        <p>ArchiveTeam scraped the Sandbox into the <a href="http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/WARC">WARC format</a>, which essentially captures websites quite thoroughly in how individual pages connect to one another. They are great for preserving websites as historical records, but do not preserve site features such as search.</p>
        <p>Indeed, this archive as well as other automated scrapes of the Sandbox are what underly navigating through <a href="https://web.archive.org/">sandbox.yoyogames.com</a> on the Wayback Machine. One cannot use the search box that was originally on the site however—this website aims to provide just that.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5 mt-2 mb-2">How does the site work?</h3>
        <p>I partially reconstructed the database of the Sandbox using scraped data from the ArchiveTeam WARCs, and subsequently pre-processed it. I use the Python web framework <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/">Flask</a> to power this site, which interfaces with this database. The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/Honno/yyg-sandbox-search">my GitHub</a> (<code>sandbox.db</code> is my final Sqlite database).</p>
        <p>The games are hosted on the <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a>, which this site simply directly links to. I uploaded the games in multiple ~50GB ZIPs, which can be seen on my <a href="https://archive.org/details/@honno">IA profile</a>. Their uploader is very clever in that it reads ZIPs and allows individual files to be accessed from them.</p>
        <p>I host this site using <a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/">PythonAnywhere</a> with the <code>yygarchive.org</code> domain bought from <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">namecheap</a>.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5 mt-2 mb-2">How are those Internet Archive ZIPs organised?</h3>
        <p>They're uploaded in alphabatical chunks—chunks because ZIP files over 50GB can be problematic to the Internet Archive's backend. They are referred to as "items" on the IA. Originally I was uploading each game <i>seperately</i> to the IA, but I was told that was a bad idea (I imagine for how the IA backend works and how it would pollute search queries).</p>
        <p>Pages for games on the Sandbox had their own slugs, but I sanitized them to a limited set of characters which would prevent compatibility problems for versions of Windows.</p>
        <p>There were duplicate slugs, which I had envisioned to be seperated by their unique database IDs in the respective slugs' folder in the respective alphabetical chunk. Unfortunately I messed this up in my script and only realised after the arduous process of uploading all the chunks, so I uploaded a <a href="https://archive.org/details/yyg-sandbox-duplicates">new item</a> just for the duplicates.</p>
        <p>There are a few games I missed uploading which I have access to, for one reason or another. I will consolidate any additional games going forward into periodic uploads.</p>
